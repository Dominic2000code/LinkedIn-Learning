    "### Collaborative Filtering Systems\n",
    "**Collaborative filtering systems** recommend items based on crowdsourced information about users' preferences for items. There are two approaches to collaborative filtering:\n",
    "- User-based\n",
    "- Item-based\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Item-based systems:** are also known as **item-to-item systems** They generate recommendations based on similarity between items with respect to user ratings of those items. In this course, we'll use Pearson correlation as the driver for an item-based recommender\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User-based systems:** recommend items based on similarity between users; \"Customers who are similar to you liked X, Y, or Z product\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content-based Recommenders\n",
    "- **Content-based recommenders** recommend items based on their features and how similar those features are to features of other items in a dataset. For example: Pandora uses content-based filtering to make its music recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Popularity-based recommendation systems\n",
    "* The most simple type of recommender system out there: popularity-based recommendation systems\n",
    "* These offer a very primitive form of collaborative filtering, where items are recommended to users based on how popular those items are among other users\n",
    "* Based on **number of reviews** rather than quality or score of reviews\n",
    "* Popularity-based recommenders:\n",
    "    - rely on purchase history\n",
    "    - are often used by online news sites like Bloomberg or NYT (rely on website user activity data set)\n",
    "    - **cannot produce personalized results** (because they don't take user data into account)"
