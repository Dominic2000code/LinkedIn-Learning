    "PyTorch is quickly becoming one of the most popular deep learning frameworks around, as well as a must-have skill in your artificial intelligence tool kit. It's gained admiration from industry leaders due to its deep integration with Python; its integration with top cloud platforms, including Amazon SageMaker and Google Cloud Platform; and its computational graphs that can be defined on the fly. In this course, join Jonathan Fernandes as he dives into the basics of deep learning using PyTorch. Starting with a working image recognition model, he shows how the different components fit and work in tandemâ€”from tensors, loss functions, and autograd all the way to troubleshooting a PyTorch network."
