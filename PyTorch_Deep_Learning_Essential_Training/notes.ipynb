    "PyTorch is quickly becoming one of the most popular deep learning frameworks around, as well as a must-have skill in your artificial intelligence tool kit. It's gained admiration from industry leaders due to its deep integration with Python; its integration with top cloud platforms, including Amazon SageMaker and Google Cloud Platform; and its computational graphs that can be defined on the fly. In this course, join Jonathan Fernandes as he dives into the basics of deep learning using PyTorch. Starting with a working image recognition model, he shows how the different components fit and work in tandemâ€”from tensors, loss functions, and autograd all the way to troubleshooting a PyTorch network."

    "* If we start off with a 28 x 28 image (for example), at the end of the flattening process, we have one long row with 784 number representing 784 pixel values.\n",
    "* You'll find that most problems are more complex than linear problems, and this is why non-linear activation functions allow the nodes to learn more complex structures in an image"

    "* When we create the class FMNIST, instead of writing all new code, the new class is to be formed initially by inheriting the attributes and methods of a previously defined base class or \"superclass\" in PyTorch.\n",
    "* This superclass is called `nn.Module`\n",
    "* This means that our class FMNIST is a **derived class or subclass**.\n",
    "* After inheriting from the `nn.Module`, we can then customize it to meet our needs.\n",
    "* **In Python OOP, whenever you create a new object, it initializes its data by calling the class's `__init__` method.** \n",
    "* You'll often find the the `__init__` is pronounced **dunder init** (dunder is short for **double underscore**)\n",
    "* Each new class you create can provide a dunder init method that specifies how to initialize an object's data attributes\n",
    "* When you call a method for a specific object, Python implicitly passes a reference to that object as the method's first argument\n",
    "* For this reason, all the methods of a class must specify at least one parameter.\n",
    "* *By convention, most Python programmers call a method's first parameter **`self`**.*\n",
    "* So, a class method must use the reference `self` to access the object's attributes and other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Because FMNIST is a subclass of the `nn.Module`, the first thing we need to do in the dunder init method is to make a call to the `nn.Module`'s dunder init method. **We do this by using a call to the superfunction, followed by the dunder init: `super().__init__()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next, declare all the layers you want to use.\n",
    "* In the example above, `fc1` = 1st fully-connected layer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `nn.Linear()`\n",
    "* What exactly is `nn.Linear()` doing? It is creating a linear transformation in the form of:\n",
    "    * **`wx + b`**\n",
    "    * (weight)(x) + (bias)\n",
    "    * `nn.Linear` automatically creates the weight and the bias tenses \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### `forward()`\n",
    "* The forward class in PyTorch is really important: this is where you define *how* your model is going to be run: from getting the input, all the way to predicting which class the image belongs to\n",
    "* It **defines model structure, components, and order of the different layers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many of the methods that we need (such as ReLu and softmax) have already been implemented in PyTorch and are in **`torch.nn.function`**\n",
    "* **In PyTorch nomenclature, you import `torch.nn.function` as `F`\n",
    "* How is the dunder init method different from the forward method?\n",
    "    * In the dunder init class, we have defined the fully-connected layer `fc1` has 784 nodes going to 128 nodes.\n",
    "    * In the forward method, we are defining the exact order of the different layers of the nn model.\n",
    "* Finally, we want to create an object of the MNIST class that we've just created \n",
    "* In OOP, you can do that by declaring `model = FMNIST()`"
