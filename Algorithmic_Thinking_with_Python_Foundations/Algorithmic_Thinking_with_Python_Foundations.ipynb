    "# Algorithmic Thinking with Python: Foundations\n",
    "**Instructor:** Robin Andrews\n",
    "\n",
    "The word “algorithm,” at one time the sole province of mathematics and computer science, has entered the modern vernacular because, for better or worse, algorithms have never been more important or more impactful in daily life. If you’re a developer, you need to be familiar with a wide range of algorithmic thinking in order to be able to solve new problems as they present themselves. If you’re already familiar with Python, becoming more versed in algorithmic thinking is a great way to increase your value as a developer. In this course, Robin Andrews explains how Python, because of its clarity and expressiveness, is the ideal tool for exploring algorithmic thinking. He shows you tools to help you understand the flow of algorithms, explains the brute force approach to solving algorithms, details the concepts of time and space complexity with regard to algorithm analysis, the decrease and conquer strategy, and much more."
