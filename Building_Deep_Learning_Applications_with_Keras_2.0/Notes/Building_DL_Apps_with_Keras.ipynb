    "**Instructor:** Adam Geitgey\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is a popular programming framework for deep learning that simplifies the process of building deep learning applications. Instead of providing all the functionality itself, it uses either TensorFlow or Theano behind the scenes and adds a standard, simplified programming interface on top. In this course, learn how to install Keras and use it to build a simple deep learning model. Explore the many powerful pre-trained deep learning models included in Keras and how to use them. Discover how to deploy Keras models, and how to transfer data between Keras and TensorFlow so that you can take advantage of all the TensorFlow tools while using Keras. When you wrap up this course, you'll be ready to start building and deploying your own models with Keras."

    "* We also have to call TF's **`.add_meta_graph_and_variables()`** function:\n",
    "    * This tells TF that we want to save both the structure of our model and the current trained weights of the model \n",
    "    * First pass reference to current Keras session : `K.get_session()`\n",
    "    * Then assign model a special tag, `tags` so that TF knows this model is meant for serving users\n",
