    "# Building and Deploying Deep Learning Applications in TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructor:** Adam Geitgey\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks available. It's used for everything from cutting-edge machine learning research to building new features for the hottest start-ups in Silicon Valley. In this course, learn how to install TensorFlow and use it to build a simple deep learning model. After he shows how to get TensorFlow up and running, instructor Adam Geitgey demonstrates how to create and train a machine learning model, as well as how to leverage visualization tools to analyze and improve your model. Finally, he explains how to deploy models locally or in the cloud. When you wrap up this course, you'll be ready to start building and deploying your own models with TensorFlow."

    "* This is usually done on your own computer \n",

    "* Python is the best-supported, and easiest, language to use with TensorFlow (whose core is written in C++ for speed).\n",
    "* TensorFlow works around the issue of Python being slow by allowing your Python code to define the structure of your ML model, but TF's high performance execution engine actually pushes data through the model and performs all the mathematical operations using C++.\n",

    "    * To code our ML algorithm, we build a computational graph of operations that TensorFlow can run. \n",
