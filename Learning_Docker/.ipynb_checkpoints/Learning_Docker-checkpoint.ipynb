    "Docker is the next step beyond virtualization. A Docker image contains everything it needs to run, independent of the Linux server on which it lives: a copy of the operating system, a database, code, configuration files, dependencies, and so on. Images can also be packaged and shared with other Docker admins. Arthur Ulfeldt uses Docker to run complex systems with millions of users and hundreds of containers. Here, he shares his knowledge with you. He introduces the basics of Docker, including its containers, Dockerfiles (or base images), and capabilities for networking, data management, infrastructure optimization, and more. Watch and learn how to build your own containers, as well as how to network and link containers."

    "### The Docker Flow: Images to Containers\n",
    "* A Docker **Image** is every file that makes up just enough of the operating system to do what you need to do.\n",
    "* Traditionally you'd install a whole operating system with everything for each application you do. With Docker, you pair it way down so that you have a l ittle container with just enough enough of the operating system to do what you need to do, and you can have lots and lots of these efficiently on a computer\n",
    "* Command to look into your Docker images is: `docker images`\n",
    "* You can always refer to a particular image by the combination of its name and its tag (example: `ubuntu:latest`) in any Docker command or you can refer to it by its number (image id). \n",
    "* The `docker run` command takes an image and turns it into a living running container with a process in it that's doing something\n",
    "* **`-ti`** stands for terminal interactive; causes it to have a full terminal within the image so that you can run the shell and get things like tab completion and formatting to work correctly\n",
    "* **`docker run -ti ubuntu:latest bash`**\n",
    "* `docker run` + `-ti` + which image to run this in + what would we like to do?\n",
    "* To exit, either run command `exit` or press Ctrl + D\n",
    "* `docker ps` (in separate terminal) to take a look at images from an outside perspective\n",
    "* `docker ps --format $FORMAT$`\n",
    "* **The container has an ID that is different from the image ID** we saw before.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What makes Docker different from running things on virtual machines or real computers?\n",
    "* When you're inside a container, you start from an image, and that image is fixed-- it doesn't change\n",
    "* When I make a container from an image, I don't change the image \n",
    "* **`touch`** command makes empty, blank files: ie `touch MY_FILE_HERE`\n",
