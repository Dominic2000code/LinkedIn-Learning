    "# Advanced AI: Transformers for NLP Using Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructor:** Jonathan Fernandes\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers have quickly become the go-to architecture for natural language processing (NLP). As a result, knowing how to use them is now a business-critical skill in your AI toolbox. In this course, instructor Jonathan Fernandes walks you through many of the key large language models developed since GPT-3. He presents a high-level overview of GLaM, Megatron-Turing NLG, Gopher, Chinchilla, PaLM, OPT, and BLOOM, relaying some of the most important insights from each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get a high-level overview of large language models, where and how they are used in production, and why they are so important to NLP. Additionally, discover the basics of transfer learning and transformer training to optimize your AI models as you go. By the end of this course, you’ll be up to speed with what’s happened since OpenAI first released GPT-3 as well as the key contributions of each of these large language models.\n"

    "- BERT and GPT-3 are examples of large language models\n",
    "- **Large language model architecture is based on transformer architecture.**\n",
    "- Transformers and large language models were proposed by a team of Google researchers in 2017 in a paper entitled: \"**Attention Is All You Need**,\" which has become a turning point in NLP.\n",
    "- Large language models have millions and often billions of parameters and are trained on enormous datasets\n",
    "- GPT-3 was released in May of 2020\n",
